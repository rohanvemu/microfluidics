# microfluidics
Repository should show all code used for Microfluidics module so peruse as you would like! The code models the flow of oil through microfluidic channels with varying diameters (constant pore size) and shows that the flow abides by the Washburn equation. Much of the code is statistical analysis and log transformations.
